## 1.7.0

- Upgrading gradle major version

- Updating gradle file structure 

## 1.6.2

* Upgrade to carp_serialization v. 2.0 - note that we now use **camelCase** for JSON.
* Support for deserialization of all `RPResult` classes and sub-classes (polymorphic serialization using the `carp_serializable` package) (issue [#83](https://github.com/cph-cachet/research.package/issues/83))
* Fix of bug in calculating score in Flanker
* Small updates to demo app

## 1.5.5

* Improved the Tapping task: edited the intro image to avoid confusion.
* Improved the Corsi Block task: corrected the French and the Portuguese translations.
* Improved the Trail Making task: added "fast and precise" instruction, and removed a duplicate instruction paragraph in case of Trail A.
* Improved the Reaction Time task: added "place the device on a flat surface" instruction, as recommended by a team of psychologists.
* Fixed the Flanker, the Picture Sequence, the Tapping, and the Trail Making tasks for the case in which the font size of the system is bigger than the standard - the instructions would overflow vertically.
* Improved the Flanker task: added the number of congruent and incongruent cards, and the mean reaction time for each type to the results.
* Changed the button "Guess" to "Submit" after recommendation from a team of psychologists.
* Changed the font color in the "Ready" button of the Picture Sequence task's instructions to force a minimum contrast with the button background.
* Improved the Reaction Time task: changed the colors to blue and yellow for color blind sensitivity.
* Improved Picture Sequence Memory task: storing the images locally in the app, so the task is possible to run while offline.
* Fixed the Tapping, Flanker, Picture Sequence Memory, Reaction Time, and Trail Making tasks not auto finishing when the showResults was false (issue [#24] <https://github.com/cph-cachet/cognition_package/issues/24>).

## 1.5.4

## 1.4.1

* Upgrade to `carp_serializable: ^1.1.0` and `research_package: ^1.3.0`. Note that this entails that all polymorphic json serialization uses the type key `__type`. Hence, the json format for all the domain classes is NOT compatible with earlier versions.
